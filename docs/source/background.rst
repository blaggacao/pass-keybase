Background / Why do I need this pass extension
==============================================

The idea behind this project is to have an encrypted backup of my gpg container maintained with pass.
One question could be why would I like to have a backup?
Here are some reasons why I want to have a backup of my gpg-encrypted passwords.

- It happened to me that I went to the office and I forget my yubikey. So I was not able to decrypt any of my passwords.
  No email, no irc, no webbased logins, no git usage or ssh logins at this time.
- It happened to me that I type in a wrong password 3 times in a row for my yubikey.
  So my yubikey was locked and I hadn't my admin/reset pin with me.
- Sometimes I'm to lazy to standup go to my physical keyring to grab my yubikey.
  In such moment it would be nice to decrypt a password without my gpg key.
